#How to contribute

RxJava is still a work in progress and has a long list of work documented in the [Issues](https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/issues).


If you wish to contribute we would ask that you:

* read [Rx Design Guidelines](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rxteam/archive/2010/10/28/rx-design-guidelines.aspx)
* review existing code and comply with existing patterns and idioms
* include unit tests
* stick to Rx contracts as defined by the Rx.Net implementation when porting operators (each issue attempts to reference the correct documentation from MSDN)
