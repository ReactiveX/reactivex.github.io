#Observable

In RxJava an object that implements the _Observer_ interface _subscribes_ to an object of the _Observable_ class. Then that subscriber reacts to whatever item or sequence of items the Observable object _emits_. This pattern facilitates concurrent operations because it does not need to block while waiting for the Observable to emit objects, but instead it creates a sentry in the form of a subscriber that stands ready to react appropriately at whatever future time the Observable does so.

This page explains what the reactive pattern is and what Observables and observers are (and how observers subscribe to Observables). Subsequent child pages (as shown in sidebar) show how you use the variety of Observable operators to link Observables together and change their behaviors.

# Background

In many software programming tasks, you more or less expect that the instructions you write will execute and complete incrementally, one-at-a-time, in order as you have written them. But in the Rx paradigm, many instructions execute in parallel and their results are later captured, in arbitrary order, by “observers.” In these cases, rather than _calling_ a method, you define a mechanism for retrieving and transforming the data, in the form of an “Observable,” and then _subscribe_ an observer to it, at which point the previously-defined mechanism fires into action with the observer standing sentry to capture and respond to its emissions whenever they arrive.

An advantage of this approach is that when you have a bunch of tasks to do that are not dependent on each other, you can start them all at the same time rather than waiting for each one to finish before starting the next one --- that way, your entire bundle of tasks only takes as long to complete as the longest task in the bundle.

There are many terms used to describe this model of asynchronous programming and design. This document will use the following terms: A _Subscriber_ (or sometimes _Observer_) _subscribes_ to an object of the _Observable_ class; that is, you _subscribe_ a _Subscriber_ to an _Observable_. An Observable _emits_ _items_ or sends _notifications_ to its Subscribers by invoking the Subscribers’ methods.

In other documents and other contexts, what we are calling a “Subscriber” (or sometimes “Observer”) is sometimes called a “watcher” or “reactor.” This model in general is often referred to as the [“reactor pattern”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern).

# Establishing Subscribers

This document usually uses Groovy for code examples, but you can use RxJava in any JVM language — such as Clojure, Scala, or JRuby, or in Java itself.  

In an ordinary method call — that is, _not_ the sort of asynchronous, parallel calls typical in reactive programming — the flow is something like this:

1. Call a method.  
1. Store the return value from that method in a variable.  
1. Use that variable and its new value to do something useful.  

Or, something like this:

```groovy
// make the call, assign its return value to `returnVal`
returnVal = someMethod(itsParameters);
// do something useful with returnVal
```

In the asynchronous model the flow goes more like this:

1. Define a method that does something useful with the return value from the asynchronous call, this method is part of the _Subscriber_.  
1. Define the asynchronous call itself as an object of the [Observable](http://netflix.github.com/RxJava/javadoc/rx/Observable.html) class.  
1. Attach the Subscriber to that Observable by _subscribing_ it (this also initiates the method call).  
1. Go on with your business; whenever the call returns, the Subscriber’s method will begin to operate on its return value or values — the _items_ emitted by the Observable.  

Which looks something like this:

```groovy
// defines, but does not invoke, the Subscriber's onNext handler
// (in this example, the Subscriber is very simple and has only an onNext handler)
def myOnNext = { it -> do something useful with it };
// defines, but does not invoke, the Observable
def myObservable = someObservable(itsParameters);
// subscribes the Subscriber to the Observable, and invokes the Observable
myObservable.subscribe(myOnNext);
// go on about my business
```

## onNext, onCompleted, and onError

The `subscribe()` method may accept one to three methods, or it may accept a `Subscriber` object or any other object that implements the `Observer` interface (which includes these three methods):

**onNext**: An Observable will call this method of its Subscribers whenever the Observable emits an item. This method takes as a parameter the item emitted by the Observable.

**onError**: An Observable will call this method of its Subscribers to indicate that it has failed to generate the expected data or has encountered some other error. This stops the Observable and it will not make further calls to `onNext` or `onCompleted`. The `onError` method takes as its parameter the `Throwable` that caused the error (or a `CompositeException` in those cases where there may have been multiple errors).

**onCompleted**: An Observable will invoke this method of its Subscribers after it has called `onNext` for the final time, if it has not encountered any errors.

A more complete `subscribe()` example would therefore look like this:

```groovy
def myOnNext     = { item -> /* do something useful with item */ };
def myError      = { throwable -> /* react sensibly to a failed call */ };
def myComplete   = { /* clean up after the final response */ };
def myObservable = someMethod(itsParameters);
myObservable.subscribe(myOnNext, myError, myComplete);
// go on about my business
```

## Unsubscribing

An object of the `Subscriber` class also implements the `unsubscribe()` method (this method is not part of the `Observer` interface, so objects that implement that interface may or may not implement this method). You can call this method to indicate that the Subscriber is no longer interested in any of the Observables it is currently subscribed to. Those Observables can then (if they have no other interested subscribers) choose to stop generating new items to emit.

The results of this unsubscription will cascade back through the chain of operators that applies to the Observable that the Subscriber subscribed to, and this will cause each link in the chain to stop emitting items. This is not guaranteed to happen immediately, however, and it is possible for an Observable to generate and attempt to emit items for a while even after no Subscribers remain to observe these emissions.

## Some Notes on Naming Conventions

The names of methods and classes in RxJava hew close to those in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Microsoft’s Reactive Extensions</a>. This has led to some confusion, as some of these names have different implications in other contexts, or seem awkward in the idiom of a particular implementing language.

For example there is the `onEvent` naming pattern (e.g. `onNext`, `onCompleted`, `onError`). In many contexts such names would indicate methods by means of which event handlers are _registered_. In the RxJava Subscriber context, however, they name the event handlers themselves.

# &ldquo;Hot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cold&rdquo; Observables

When does an Observable begin emitting its sequence of items? It depends on the Observable. A &ldquo;hot&rdquo; Observable may begin emitting items as soon as it is created, and so any observer who subscribes to that Observable may start observing the sequence somewhere in the middle. A &ldquo;cold&rdquo; Observable, on the other hand, waits until an observer subscribes to it before it begins to emit items, and so such an observer is guaranteed to see the whole sequence from the beginning.

In RxJava, there is also something called a &ldquo;Connectable&rdquo; Observable. Such an Observable does not begin emitting items until its `connect( )` method is called, whether or not any observers have subscribed to it.

# Composition via Observable Operators

The `Observable`/`Subscriber`/`Observer` classes along with `onNext`/`onError`/`onCompleted` are only the start of RxJava. By themselves they’d be nothing more than a slight extension of the standard observer pattern, better suited to handling a sequence of events rather than a single callback.

The real power comes with the “reactive extensions” (hence “Rx”) — operators that allow you to transform, combine, manipulate, and work with the sequences of items emitted by Observables.

These Rx operators allow you to compose asynchronous sequences together in a declarative manner with all the efficiency benefits of callbacks but without the drawbacks of nesting callback handlers that are typically associated with asynchronous systems.

These pages include information about some operators that are not part of the core of RxJava but are implemented in a variety of contributed modules that you must include separately as part of your project.
